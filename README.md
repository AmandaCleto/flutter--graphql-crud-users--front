## üí° Idea:
Create a Flutter Project in order to connect to a GraphQL Server (https://github.com/AmandaCleto/vanilla--graphql-crud-users-and-posts-api--back/). For that, I'll be using ```graphql_flutter``` as dependence.
The project is a simple crud of posts and users, where you can create/read/delete posts from an user and create/read/update/delete users;
note: when deleting an user all its posts will be deleted as well.

## üéá Apprenticeship:
This project was meant to be a learning project in how to use GraphQL in Flutter, for that, I first create a GraphQL server by following the tutorial from [<ins>Mateus Silva</ins>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RoHxSGVAdU&list=PLPXWI3llyMiK9uw7tfljM2hnQl2qu6CeT), then I proceed by creating a simple landing page layout in [<ins>Figma web design app</ins>](https://www.figma.com), so I could use as prototype to my Flutter app.

By using ```graphql_flutter``` as dependence, I could fetch only the necessary responses my pages would display, and also could refetch only when needed.


```graphql_flutter``` is an easy-to-use library that is filled with lots of functionalities, yet, in this project I focus in how to use the basics of Mutations and Queries.

- Step 2- Copy the contents of the ```.env.example``` file to your new .env file;
- Step 3- Paste your API_HTTP_LINK KEY into the variable API_HTTP_LINK
#### After the env setup, proceed with the steps below ‚úå
